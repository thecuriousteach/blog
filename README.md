## Welcome to The Curious Teach's Blog

This blog walks the final line between my full-time life of teaching scince and my full-time desire to learn coding.  Watch this page for my musings, failures, successes, and learnings on both teaching, coding, and teaching coding!

### Where to Begin?

**I wanted to learn something new...**
I have come so far into teaching, and have learn and grown so much, but I wanted to learn more.  So I spent this summer break learning how to code!
